# Blog Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple blog application built with React as part of my learning process. I followed a YouTube tutorial on React to understand the concepts and implement the functionality.

## Features
- Fetching blog data from a server (Mock API)
- Displaying all the blogs
- Filtering blogs by region

## Current Issues
### 404 Page on Refresh or undefined URLs
The application is deployed in Github Pages. The website may display a 404 error when a page is refreshed. This is because GitHub Pages does not natively support Single Page Applications (SPA) routing. Currently trying to fix it and also exploring other hosting options :)
