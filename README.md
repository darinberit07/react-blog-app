#Vite documentation:
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Blog Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple blog application built with React as part of my learning process. I followed a YouTube tutorial on React to understand the concepts and implement the functionality.

## Features
- Fetching blog data from a server (Mock API)
- Displaying all the blogs
- Filtering blogs by region
