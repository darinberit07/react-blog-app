# Blog Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple blog application built with React as part of my learning process. I followed a YouTube tutorial on React to understand the concepts and implement the functionality.
This project is created using the Vite build tool instead of the Create React app.
Vite documentation: [https://vitejs.dev/guide/](url)
## Features
- Fetching blog data from a server (Mock API)
- Displaying all the blogs
- Filtering blogs by region

## Current Issues
### 404 Page on Refresh or undefined URLs
The application is deployed in Github Pages. The website may display a 404 error when a page is refreshed. This is because GitHub Pages does not natively support Single Page Applications (SPA) routing. The best way to avoid this issue is to not refresh the page or directly navigate to URLs, and use only the webpage navigation links.
Currently trying to fix it and also exploring other hosting options :)
